#Image Encrypter


This is a simple python library for encrypting images. It uses a 2-key permutation system to biject the pixels in a given image.

It currently acts on every pixel in the image. It is entirely possible (and sensible) to have the algorithm select groups of pixels to biject - this would improve computational efficiency.
